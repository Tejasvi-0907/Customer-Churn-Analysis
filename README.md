# Customer Churn Analysis
Telco Customer Churn Analysis â€“ EDA Project with Python
Welcome to my first Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project, where I explored a telecom dataset to understand the factors influencing customer churn. This project was completed using Python and essential data analysis libraries.

Objective -
To identify key patterns and features that contribute to customer churn in the telecom industry using EDA techniques.

Tools & Libraries Used -
Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Key Insights -

Customers on monthly contracts are more likely to churn.

Fiber optic users show higher churn rates than DSL users.

Lack of security and backup services is linked to higher churn.

Long-term contract users (one or two years) tend to stay longer.

Outcomes -
This project helped me:

Strengthen my EDA skills using Python.

Translate raw data into actionable business insights.

Create meaningful visualizations to support conclusions.
